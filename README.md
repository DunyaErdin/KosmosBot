# 🇬🇷 Kosmos Visa Automation Bot (Experimental Project)

This is a bot prototype created for automating the visa appointment system of **Greece (Kosmos platform)** using **Python and Playwright**.

> ⚠️ This bot is also **unsuccessful** at the moment — it gets detected and blocked. Still, it has educational value and is shared for open learning and community contribution.

## 🎯 Goal

- Simulate user behavior on the Kosmos visa site
- Learn how DOM automation and browser scripting works
- Understand the basics of bot detection and system response

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python
- Playwright
- Terminal-based execution
- Human-like delays and interactions

## 🚧 Status

- Not functioning successfully due to detection
- Valuable as a reference for structure, automation steps, and interaction flow
- Not built to evade sophisticated detection systems

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

- How web automation tools work
- Common pitfalls in bot development
- Ethical limitations and boundaries in automation

## ⚠️ Important Notice

Do **not** use this bot for real visa submissions. It is for testing, experimenting, and educational use only. Using it on real services may violate terms of use.

## 🤝 Contributions Welcome
