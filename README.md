## üöÄ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get your Greece Visa Bot up and running.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the `kosmos-visa-automation` repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kosmos-visa-automation/kosmos-visa-automation.git
cd kosmos-visa-automation
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(Note: A `requirements.txt` file should be created in the project root listing all dependencies, e.g., `selenium`, `beautifulsoup4`, etc.)*

### Step 4: Environment Configuration

The bot requires specific credentials and configuration details to operate. These should be stored as environment variables or in a `.env` file for security.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project:

```ini
# .env example
VISA_USERNAME="your_visa_portal_username"
VISA_PASSWORD="your_visa_portal_password"
APPLICANT_NAME="John Doe"
APPLICANT_DOB="YYYY-MM-DD"
# Add other necessary configuration variables here
```
*(Note: You might need to install `python-dotenv` if you plan to use a `.env` file: `pip install python-dotenv`)*


## üí° Usage Examples

Once installed and configured, you can run the bot.

### Basic Execution

To start the visa automation process, simply run the `Main.py` script:

```bash
python Main.py
```

The bot will then proceed based on its internal logic and your configuration, such as attempting to log in, fill forms, or search for appointments.

### Configuration Options

The bot's behavior can be customized via the environment variables (or `.env` file) set during installation.

| Variable Name       | Description                                      | Example Value          |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| `VISA_USERNAME`     | Username for the visa application portal         | `your_email@example.com` |
| `VISA_PASSWORD`     | Password for the visa application portal         | `MySecurePassword123`  |
| `APPLICANT_NAME`    | Full name of the visa applicant                  | `Dunya Erdin`          |
| `APPLICANT_DOB`     | Date of birth of the applicant (YYYY-MM-DD)      | `1990-01-15`           |
| `TARGET_CITY`       | Desired city for visa appointment (e.g., Athens) | `Athens`               |
| `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL`| Email for receiving status updates               | `notify@example.com`   |
